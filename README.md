# MusicApp

Our application interestingly compels users to complete a music-related survey to build a sense of what type fo music they would like to hear. This survey asks questions relative to: mood, genre, and age group. Based on responses to the survey, an  absorbing musical playlist is formed in a matter of seconds.
